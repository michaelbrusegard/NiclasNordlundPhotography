        <p>
            For the functional requirements the website will allow for easy navigation both on the same page and throughout the entire website, 
            our goal is to have a shop-function available for customers to place orders.
            We will also assist in the possibility for customers to either come in direct contact with our client, or if they wish the see more of his photos
            by links on our website which will redirect customers to his social media.
            As for the non-functional requirements we want the photos to formatted properly in order for the website to load as quickly as possible for the customers.
            For the website to be scaled appropriately for different devices. The website will be available across multiple web-browsers.
