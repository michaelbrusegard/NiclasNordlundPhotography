        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more. Additionally, he sells calendars, and 
            wants an easier way for customers to reach him.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>
            The main purpose of the website will be to promote and showcase Niclas' 
            previous photography work. He wants to make it easy for potential clients
            (both companies or individuals) to browse through the work he has already 
            done, and get a general sense of what he is capable of as a photographer.  
            A secondary objective would
            be to implement a payment solution, or an otherwise convenient way of 
            purchasing products/services through the website, such as ordering
            calendars or digital photos directly.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The main audience for the website is professional customers interested in 
            Niclas’ photos. The site is therefore intended to showcase his previous 
            work and make it easier to sell photographs without having to be in contact 
            with every single customer manually. Another aspect is his need to demonstrate 
            the different products. Since the intended audience is primarily professionals, 
            the website needs to appear professional as well. In order to reach new 
            potential customers, the website needs to demonstrate what types of photography 
            he is most experienced with, such as landscapes and wedding photos. He also 
            wants to sell calendars, which are intended for non-professional customers.
