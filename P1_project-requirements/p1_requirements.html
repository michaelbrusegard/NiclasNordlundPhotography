        P1 tasks:
        
        1. At the top of the document, there should be your names, as authors, just as you would for any formal paper, together with the date.
           
           Status: done 
        
        2. Administrative details: the name of your client, and his or her position in the organization (or company), if applicable.
           
           Status: done
        
        3. The site"s purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals 
           and specific content elements of the site. 
           
           Status: in progress
        
        4. Who is the intended audience or typical user? Describe them and their needs for information and other content.
           
           Status: not done
        
        5. A description of the content of the site and how it is organized. Think of this as the outline of a paper: 
           it doesn"t have to spell out the sentences or even the paragraphs, but it should mention major sections and 
           even a few salient subsections. In your conference, be prepared to discuss the site"s content, and to explore
           the feasibility of its design. 
           
           Status: not done
        
        6. The document must be in essay form (paragraphs of text, not just a bullet list or set of bullet lists), although 
           you may use bullet lists when they are appropriate. It must be written in HTML; not a MS Word document, PDF file, etc.
           
           Status: not done
