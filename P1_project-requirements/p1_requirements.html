        3. The site's purpose and goals and how they will be accomplished by the site. Try to draw a connection between the goals 
           and specific content elements of the site. 
        
        4. Who is the intended audience or typical user? Describe them and their needs for information and other content.
        
        5. A description of the content of the site and how it is organized. Think of this as the outline of a paper: 
           it doesn't have to spell out the sentences or even the paragraphs, but it should mention major sections and 
           even a few salient subsections. In your conference, be prepared to discuss the site's content, and to explore
           the feasibility of its design. 
        
        6. The document must be in essay form (paragraphs of text, not just a bullet list or set of bullet lists), although 
           you may use bullet lists when they are appropriate. It must be written in HTML; not a MS Word document, PDF file, etc.
