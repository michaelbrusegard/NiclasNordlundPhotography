        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more, and has been looking for an easier way for customers to 
            reach him.</p>

        <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>
            The main purpose of the website will be to promote and showcase Niclas' 
            previous photography work, as well as trying to implement a payment solution 
            for purchasing digital photos. The main audience for the website is 
            professional customers interested in Niclas’ photographies.

        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The basis of our navigation structure is a simple rollover menu at the top of the page. 
            Here, the home page (home.html), which is also our landing page, is always accessible 
            from any other page on our website. We feature a "showcase mode" and a "shopping mode", 
            where the rollover menu changes based on which mode we are in, including links to 
            different categories of pages. The navigation bar will also be responsive based on the width 
            of the page; when viewing the showcase mode on a mobile phone, the category links are
            found behind the click a hamburger button found in the top left on each showcase page.
        </p><p>
            The purpose of the showcase mode is to easily be able to navigate between any of the pages 
            related to browsing the photo showcase, namely the nature.html, animals.html, architectural.html, 
            portrait.html, wedding.html and sport.html pages. We also include a link to the shop.html 
            page within the rollover menu of the showcase mode. The purpose of the shopping mode is to easily 
            navigate within the shop.html page, with an included checkout function only visible within the shopping mode.
            The user navigates back to the showcase mode through a link to the home page (found in the rollover menu).
        </p><p>
            We aim to make the transition between modes as intuitive as possible, so that the user may freely 
            decide to either browse or shop without getting stuck. The storyboard figure below shows how each page
            is connected, and how the shopping mode is somewhat isolated from the showcase mode.

        <h2>Page Layout and Appearence</h2>
        <p>
            Our thought process on how the website should look and work, was to make it as easy as possible to navigate, 
            while also not hurting the eyes of the user. The colors we use for the background will be simple, 
            and not overly complicated, to avoid taking the focus away from the photographies. 
            We have made different categories where the customers can look at 
            photos that might interest them. When the customer is browsing each page, 
            the category of that page will light up with a splash effect to show exactly where the customer is browsing.
            The site where the user will be able to shop photos will be accessible from every catergory, 
            making it simple for the customers to use. The home page will contain information about Niclas, 
            and will be accessible from every page on the website.
            
            The font choices are based on the watermark signature displayed on Niclas' photographies; the font used in the 
            navigation bar is based on a hand-written style, while the content part of the page uses a font focused on readability.
            In the footer element, we will add all of Niclas' contact information, as well as social media so that 
            customers will be able to get updates on new photographies, calendars etc.
            The website will be responsive to smaller screens, which means it will be easier to use a mobile phone while 
            browsing/shopping.

            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ul>
            <li>There are two fonts on the website, and both are based on Niclas' logo. The first is a font called 
                "caveat cursive" with a handwritten look, mainly used for the different categories in the navbar. 
                The font resembles Niclas' signature.
                The second font is Noto Sans Mono, weight 200. The font resembles the one used in the word 
                "photography" in the logo. This is a sans serif font and the main font on the site.</li>

            <li>The color scheme is oriented towards putting emphasis on the photos on the site. 
                Navbar: #add8e6</li>

            <li>The width of the body, navbar and footer are all 100% of the screen.</li>

            <li>All links in the navbar will link to internal web pages. The link to his instagram and 
                facebook accounts will link to external pages.</li> 

            <li>The navbar will be a normal horizontal bar at the top for desktop users and a hamburger 
                menu which can be expanded and closed on phones. It will contain internal links to the different 
                photo categories.</li>

            <li>The footer will contain contact information and links to Niclas' Instagram and Facebook 
                accounts. It has the same height as the navbar and is only visible when the user has 
                scrolled to the bottom.</li>
            
            <li>The website logo is Niclas' signature and the word "photography", and acts as a "home" 
                button on the website. When the signature is clicked, the user is directed to the main 
                website. The logo will be in the top left corner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>There are a total of eight different HTML pages on our website, all sharing a similar style.
            As explained earlier, the showcase mode features pages of a similar structure, and so we will bundle 
            together the (6) pages in this category with two generalized mockups (desktop and mobile variants).
        </p>
        <h4>The home page</h4>
        <p>The first page the user will arrive on when accesing our webpage is home.html. This homepage will be 
            where we give information about our client Niclas. On this page we will show of a picture of him holding 
            his dog to show some personality and make him seem approachable. We will also have him write about
            himself and add that text to this page. The plan is to display his favourite photos on this page to show
            some of his personality as well as adding some fancier display options for these photos when you load the
            page. We may also add a quote from him with a type in animation to make it seem professional. On the homepage
            we will display the footer at all times. This is to have a place where Niclas' contact information can be
            accesible at all times. So it doesn't mattter how far down you will scroll, the footer will always be there.</p>

                <b>Figure 3:</b> Mockup of the home page
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h4>The showcase pages</h4>
        <p>We consider nature.html, animals.html, architectural.html, portrait.html, wedding.html, sport.html (all of the 
            different photo categories) to be the showcase pages. The main purpose of these pages is to show of Niclas' work
            while being easy on the eyes and not distracting. We will have the photos on this page on a grid based around the 
            width of the photos so the aspect ratio won't matter and we will get a clean look. We will alter the amount of pictures
            displayed next to each other after which page the user is on and if it's on mobile or not. The idea is to have 
            grander photos like landscape and nature with only one row, while categories like sport and animals can use 3 or 4
            without taking away from the viewing experience. On all mobile showcase pages we will most likely only display a single
            row as illustrated in figure 5.</p>

        </figure>
        <h4>The shopping page</h4>
        <p>When you first click the bag icon you will be taken into shopping mode. The navigation bar will change and be simplified
            to only display the bag icon, Niclas' logo for the home page as well as a cart icon for checkout. We do this to separate 
            shopping from showcase as much as possible. The reason for this is that most induviduals want to only look at Niclas' work
            through his showcase pages and then contact him to buy physical pictures or buy a photoshoot etc. The shop page is for the
            most part for cooperations that already know what they want. And we do not need to show them all the showcase pages when they
            are trying to buy photos. Also it will work well if you only link the shopping page to the cooperations since then it will
            be as efficient as possible for them to buy photos quickly. If we add many distractions and extra unnecessary buttons the
            chance of people choosing not to buy increases. 
        </p>
        <p>We consider shop.html. This page is all about efficiency. We want to make it as easy as possible for customers to buy digital 
            copies of Niclas' pictures. Here we will try to display as many pictures as possible based
            on the page width. These pictures will be low res versions that are easily loaded but still identifiable. They will each
            display a price, identifier (This will either be a name, date or number based on what Niclas choses, in the mockup we used
            IMG as the identifier) and an 'Add to cart' button. In the right corner there will be a cart icon where you can checkout
            to pay and get your digital copies. Most likely we will remove the fucntionality from the checkout button when we deliver the 
            webpage since it will use the Stripe API which is not a part of this project.

        <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>We plan to include at least six different features using JavaScript.</p>
        <h4>1. fadeOnScroll.js</h4>
        <p>This script will create a fading effect on the web page when scrolling;
            the content at the top of the page will fade out, and content at the bottom of the page will fade in.
            Some of this functionality can probably be achieved just by CSS styling, but as of now we have it listed
            as a JavaScript feature file. We will include this effect on all pages of our website.</p>
        <h4>2. shoppingCart.js</h4>
        <p>This script will draw a red dot with an indicator of the amount of items in the shopping cart.
            If we have time, we will also try to create an on-click animation of the item being dropped in 
            the cart within this script.</p>
        <h4>3. slideTransition.js</h4>
        <p>This script includes on-click animations transitioning between the showcase mode and the shopping mode.
            The navigation bar will change by "sliding over" the shopping bag icon from the right side to the left side.
            Meanwhile, the reverse effect will happen when returning from the shopping page to the home page.
        </p>
        <h4>4. quotesTyping.js</h4>
        <p>This script will create a typing effect for the parts of the home page displaying text.
            For instance, sets of quotes may "type themselves" when we reach that part of the web page.
        </p>
        <h4>5. splashOnClick.js</h4>
        <p>This script will add a "splashing effect" around the actively selected category when browsing in 
            showcase mode. Parts of this can be done with CSS, but we also aim to create an on-click 
            animation where we utilize some JavaScript.
        </p>
        <h4>6. checkoutSystem.js</h4>
        <p>This script will keep track of which items have been added to cart when in shopping mode.
            The information for each item (including pricing) may for instance be stored in a dictionary, 
            from which we only need to keep track of selected indices. We want to store this information in a way 
            that makes us able to transfer the same information to a payment solution (assuming we are able
            to implement this).

        <h3>Plan</h3>
        <h4>Directory structure</h4>
        <p> All project files are contained under a "Site" directory on the folk.ntnu servers. 
            The project hierarchy will be structured as follows, focused mainly on storing the 
            showcase photos categorically:</p>
