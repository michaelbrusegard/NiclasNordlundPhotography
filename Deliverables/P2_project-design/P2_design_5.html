        <h3>Purpose, goals and audience</h3>
        <p>
            The main purpose of the website will be to promote and showcase Niclas' 
            previous photography work, as well as trying to implement a payment solution 
            for purchasing calendars/photos. The main audience for the website is 
            professional customers interested in Niclas’ photos.

        <h3>Navigation Structure</h3>
        <p>
            The basis of our navigation structure is a simple rollover menu at the top of the page. 
            Here, the home page (home.html), which is also our landing page, is always accessible 
            from any other page on our website. We feature a "showcase mode" and a "shopping mode", 
            where the rollover menu changes based on which mode we are in, including links to 
            different categories of pages. 
        </p><p>
            The purpose of the showcase mode is to easily be able to navigate between any of the pages 
            related to browsing the photo showcase, namely the home.html, landscapes.html, animals.html, 
            portraits.html, weddings.html and calendars.html pages. We also include a link to the shop.html 
            page within the rollover menu of the showcase mode. The purpose of the shopping mode is to easily 
            navigate between the shop.html and checkout.html pages, where the only way back to the showcase 
            mode is through a link to the home page (found in the rollover menu).
        </p><p>
            We aim to make the transition between modes as intuitive as possible, so that the user may freely 
            decide to either browse or shop without getting stuck. The storyboard figure below shows how each page
            is connected, and how the shopping mode is somewhat isolated from the showcase mode.
