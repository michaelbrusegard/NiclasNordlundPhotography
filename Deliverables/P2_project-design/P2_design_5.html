        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more. Additionally, he sells calendars, and 
            wants an easier way for customers to reach him.</p>

        <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
        <p>
            The main purpose of the website will be to promote and showcase Niclas' 
            previous photography work, as well as trying to implement a payment solution 
            for purchasing calendars/photos. The main audience for the website is 
            professional customers interested in Niclas’ photos.

        <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
        <p>
            The basis of our navigation structure is a simple rollover menu at the top of the page. 
            Here, the home page (home.html), which is also our landing page, is always accessible 
            from any other page on our website. We feature a "showcase mode" and a "shopping mode", 
            where the rollover menu changes based on which mode we are in, including links to 
            different categories of pages. 
        </p><p>
            The purpose of the showcase mode is to easily be able to navigate between any of the pages 
            related to browsing the photo showcase, namely the home.html, landscapes.html, animals.html, 
            portraits.html, weddings.html and calendars.html pages. We also include a link to the shop.html 
            page within the rollover menu of the showcase mode. The purpose of the shopping mode is to easily 
            navigate between the shop.html and checkout.html pages, where the only way back to the showcase 
            mode is through a link to the home page (found in the rollover menu).
        </p><p>
            We aim to make the transition between modes as intuitive as possible, so that the user may freely 
            decide to either browse or shop without getting stuck. The storyboard figure below shows how each page
            is connected, and how the shopping mode is somewhat isolated from the showcase mode.
        </p>

        <h2>Page Layout and Appearence</h2>
        <p>
            Our thought process on how the website should look and work, was to make it as easy as possible to navigate, 
            while also not hurting the eyes of the user. The colors we use for the background will be simple, 
            and not overcomplicated to not take focus away from the photographies. 
            We have made different categories where the customers can look at 
            photos that might interest them. When the customer are browsing each page, 
            the category of that page will light up to show which one the customer is browsing.
            The site where the user will be able to shop photos will be accessible from every catergory, 
            making it simple for the customers to use. The home page will contain information about Niclas, 
            and will be accessible from every single page on the website.
            
            The font we have used is easy to read, while also looking a bit fancy. Kind of like his signature. 
            In the footer element, we will add all of Niclas' contact information, as well as social media so that 
            customers will be able to get updates on new photographies, calendars etc.
            The website will be responsive to smaller screens, which means it will be easier to use a mobile phone while looking/shopping.
