        <h2>The Changes</h2>
        <p>
            The current state of the website is generally what we envisioned in the 
            <a href='../P2_project-design/P2_design_5.html'>design phase</a>, 
            but the way it was implemented into each file turned out very different from what we initially planned.
            A general trend was that we moved content from HTML to be loaded in JavaScript, and animations split intro
            both CSS and JavaScript. Many of the planned files were either renamed or merged into one bigger file.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to HTML file setup</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the HTML files now look very similar, where we have the navbar header, footer, and one general 
            page container div inbetween. Each showcase page contains a lot of images, so instead of placing them in one-by-one in 
            the HTML files, we instead load it in from the JavaScript file called showcase.js. This way, if we want to add new images,
            we can just update the arrays in JavaScript instead of hard coding many lines in the HTML. The HTML files differ
            in some respects, where for instance we have elements for the checkout menu only in shop.html, a gallery only 
            on the showcase pages, and quote elements only for the home page.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to CSS files</h4>
        <p>
            We realized that some of the animations originally planned for JavaScript could be done using CSS. An example is the fade-on-scroll
            for the text on the home page, where we ended up using snap-scrolling and transitions in CSS instead of having a JavaScript file for it.
            One useful feature that we did not consider during the design phase was the use of CSS variables to control the parameters of multiple 
            elements at once. We created a file called style.css containing all these variables in one place, and use these variables across
            the other CSS files, and sometimes in the JavaScript files.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to JavaScript files</h4>
        <p>
            Alongside the scripts we already had planned for, we now also include some scripts dedicated to loading images, animating images on-scroll,
            and positioning some elements that were difficult to place using CSS mediaqueries. For each section (home, showcase, shop) of the website,
            the JavaScript files are divided into main files (home.js, showcase.js, shop.js) and secondary files (see the scripts/ directory in the 
            organizational scheme below). The main files contain variables, eventlisteners and intersection observers, while the secondary files 
            contain only functions that can called from the main files. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            One direct change is that we merged the shoppingCart.js file into the checkoutSystem.js. We now use one file to control animations for 
            the shopping cart and shop items, in addition to keeping track of the item information and price total. The checkout button displays this 
            information in an alert box, with no payment solution added yet. We also ended up discarding the idea of a splash effect script as we 
            felt it did not really fit the theme of the website aesthetically.
        </p>
        <h4>Summary of files/directories added, renamed, changed or removed</h4>

        <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Erik, Magnus and Otto worked on the JavaScript files on the home page related to 
            the image carousel and the text. Specifically, Erik worked on the image carousel,
            Magnus worked on the text being written and Otto worked on the text disappearing
            and reappearing. Michael and Martin worked on the JavaScript files on the showcase pages, the navbar 
            and footer, as well as the shop. Everyone worked on the tasks they were assigned in P2, but the file names
            were later changed. Magnus and Otto worked on files which were merged into home.js and homeElements.js. 
        </p>
    </section>
    <br>
    <section>
        <h2>Modularity Requirement</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Indicate how the modularity requirement was handled and who was responsible for
                the implementation.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Navbars and footers were implemented by Michael and Martin respectively. The navbar required some extra work for
            the slide animation to work properly when animating across different pages. For this reason, the JavaScript file 
            nav.js was made to keep track of animations and between which pages a user is navigating. This file is imported into
            each HTML page, as are the nav.css and footer.css styling files.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The main way we implemented modularity on our website was through the showcase page system. Instead of copy pasting 

            In our JavaScript files we made sure to not duplicate too much code by reusing functions such as for instance 
            isPortrait(), which checks if a user is viewing in a mobile portrait.
            
            (Focus on navbar and common css variables across files)
        </p>

    <section>
        <h2>Updated Organizational Scheme</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Explicitly state (since it may have changed since the design document), which person
                worked on which files, including CSS and JavaScript files, and who produced the
                artwork (banner and button design, etc.).
            </em>
        </p>
        <h4>Directory structure</h4>
        <p> All project files are contained under a "Site" directory on the folk.ntnu servers. 
            The final project hierarchy is structured as follows:</p>
        <div class='planStructure'>
