        <h2>The Changes</h2>
        <p>
            The current state of the website is generally what we envisioned in the 
            <a href='../P2_project-design/P2_design_5.html'>design phase</a>, 
            but the way it was implemented into each file turned out very different from what we initially planned.
            A general trend was that we moved content from HTML to be loaded in JavaScript, and animations split intro
            both CSS and JavaScript. Many of the planned files were either renamed or merged into one bigger file.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to HTML file setup</h4>
        <p>
            Most of the HTML files now look very similar, where we have the navbar header, footer, and one general 
            page container div inbetween. Each showcase page contains a lot of images, so instead of placing them in one-by-one in 
            the HTML files, we instead load it in from the JavaScript file called showcase.js. This way, if we want to add new images,
            we can just update the arrays in JavaScript instead of hard coding many lines in the HTML. The HTML files differ
            in some respects, where for instance we have elements for the checkout menu only in shop.html, a gallery only 
            on the showcase pages, and quote elements only for the home page. We achieved the look we were going for on each HTML page
            based on what we wanted from the design phase.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to CSS files</h4>
        <p>
            We realized that some of the animations originally planned for JavaScript could be done using CSS. An example is the fade-on-scroll
            for the text on the home page, where we ended up using snap-scrolling and transitions in CSS instead of having a JavaScript file for it.
            One useful feature that we did not consider during the design phase was the use of CSS variables to control the parameters of multiple 
            elements at once. We created a file called style.css containing all these variables in one place, and use these variables across
            the other CSS files, and sometimes in the JavaScript files.
        </p>
        <h4>Changes to JavaScript files</h4>
        <p>
            Alongside the scripts we already had planned for, we now also include some scripts dedicated to loading images, animating images on-scroll,
            and positioning some elements that were difficult to place using CSS mediaqueries. For each section (home, showcase, shop) of the website,
            the JavaScript files are divided into main files (home.js, showcase.js, shop.js) and secondary files (see the scripts/ directory in the 
            organizational scheme below). The main files contain variables, eventlisteners and intersection observers, while the secondary files 
            contain only functions that can called from the main files. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            One direct change is that we merged the shoppingCart.js file into the checkoutSystem.js. We now use one file to control animations for 
            the shopping cart and shop items, in addition to keeping track of the item information and price total. The checkout button displays this 
            information in an alert box, with no payment solution added yet. We also ended up discarding the idea of a splash effect script as we 
            felt it did not really fit the theme of the website aesthetically.
        </p>
        <h4>Summary of files/directories added, renamed, changed or removed</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><b>fadeOnScroll.js:</b> changed to focus on showcase images instead of home page text.</li>

        <h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Erik, Magnus and Otto worked on the JavaScript files on the home page related to 
            the image carousel and the text. Specifically, Erik worked on the image carousel,
            Magnus worked on the text being written and Otto worked on the text disappearing
            and reappearing. Michael and Martin worked on the JavaScript files on the showcase pages, the navbar 
            and footer, as well as the shop. Everyone worked on the tasks they were assigned in P2, but the file names
            were later changed. Magnus and Otto worked on files which were merged into home.js and homeElements.js. 
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Modularity Requirement</h2>
        <p> 
            The main way we implemented modularity on our website was through our use of CSS variables. The page colors, navbar 
            height, image margins and animation/transition length defined in style.css were all commonly used throughout the other
            CSS files instead of writing out the actual values. This made it easier for us to change the style of multiple elements
            at once, such as the scale/color scheme etc. Michael came up with the idea to make a CSS variable file, and Martin has
            since added more variables for different sections of the project.
        </p>
        <p> 
            In our JavaScript files we made sure to not duplicate too much code by reusing functions, such as for instance the
            isPortrait() function, which checks if a user is viewing in mobile portrait mode. For all the showcase pages, which are structurally 
            identical, we made a single JavaScript file called showcase.js with the different image arrays in one place; instead of
            making intersection observers for each page, we here check the file name of the current window to see which array to use.
            The majority of the JavaScript files were written by Michael and Martin, and thus they were the ones responsible for coordinating
            this implementation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Navbars and footers were implemented by Michael and Martin respectively. The navbar required some extra work for
            the slide animation to work properly when animating across different pages. For this reason, the JavaScript file 
            nav.js was made to keep track of animations and between which pages a user is navigating. This single file is imported into
            each HTML page, as are the nav.css and footer.css styling files. Instead of duplicating the navbar/footer CSS for every HTML
            page, this approach allowed us to only define the styling once.
        </p>

        <h2>Updated Organizational Scheme</h2>
        <h4>Directory structure</h4>
        <p> All project files are contained under a "Site" directory on the folk.ntnu servers.
