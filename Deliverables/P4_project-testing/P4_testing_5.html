        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more, and has been looking for an easier way for customers to 
            reach him, as well as a way to showcase his previous work.</p>

        <h2>Testing Document</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
                well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
                the website.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The questionnaire contained a link to the website and a brief introduction to our project. 
            It started out with questions about device, age and amount of bugs found, for sorting the data.
            The rest of the questions were about the website itself, and how the user felt about it.
            The questionnaire can be found 
            <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_Pl9sJ3HO_aHosFrUkL0ad4VlblBuCEjGxQsAUfBIzrjkGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>.
            We then asked about user experience, and how the user felt about the website.
            In the end, we asked if anything did not work as expected, and if the user had any other comments.

        <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
                your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
                students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
                do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
                well.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The target audience for our client is mainly companies, and seeing how it's not as simple for us to reach out to 
            the preferred target audience, we had friends and family test the website for us. We have recieved answers from ages ranging 
            21 years to 79 years with the average age of our testers combined being 43. The answer diagram is shown below. We also contacted our client, Niclas, and asked him 
            to provide feedback in the same way as in the questionnare.

        <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            The testers were asked which devices they used to test the website, and the results are as follows:
            70.6% on phone, 29.4% on computer. Respondents were asked about their browser, and the results are as follows:
            52.9% on Safari, 35.3% on Chrome, and 11.8% on Firefox. The answer diagrams are shown below.

        <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A summary of the feedback you received organized by
                question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive
                comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the comments we recieved from those testing were that the first impression of the website was good, in general people
            were fond of the design choices we have made for our showcase sites. 
            When it comes to user friendliness a lot of the feedback was positive regarding navigating through the website, however we
            got some valuable comments on a few elements of the site which could be improved. 
            For instance when you are in the checkout menu it is not intuitive how to remove the selected images from your shopping cart, and
            some users reported problems with the carousel and text on the home page.
            Our client was very happy with the result, as seen in his response (translated from swedish to english):

        <h2>Our Response</h2>
        <p>
            All suggestions from the testers are feasible for us to implement, and we have already made some changes to the website 
            based on the feedback we recieved. We fixed the "back to top" button to the bottom of the home page, which was not working during testing.
            Another issue we decided to fix were the problems that occured with the carousel and the text for the home page.
            We have not started to work on a more intuitive checkout menu, but we have ideas that would involve having a "cross-out" button in the top right of 
            each shop item that would remove the item from the cart.

        <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        <p>
            Teamwork and communication is key. We have learned how difficult it can 
            be to work with several people in the same documents and quite a bit about Git.
            One of the group members spent a couple of weeks without being able to fetch the
            Git repo, but luckily the team was able to help him out. We have also learned
            how difficult it can be to communicate with a client. Neither party had any
            experience with making a website, so it wasn't easy to know what could and couldn't
            be done.
