        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more, and has been looking for an easier way for customers to

        <h2>Testing Document</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
                well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
                the website.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The questionnaire contained a link to the website and a brief introduction to our project. 
            It started out with questions about device, age and amount of bugs found, for sorting the data.
            The rest of the questions were about the website itself, and how the user felt about it.
            The questionnaire can be found <a style="color:aquamarine" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_Pl9sJ3HO_aHosFrUkL0ad4VlblBuCEjGxQsAUfBIzrjkGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. 
            We then asked about user experience, and how the user felt about the website.
            In the end, we asked if anything did not work as expected, and if the user had any other comments.

        <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
                your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
                students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
                do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
                well.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The target audience for our client is mainly companies, and seeing how it's not as simple for us to reach out to 
            the preferred target audience, we had friends and family test the website for us. We have recieved answers from ages ranging 
            21 years to 79 years with the average age of our testers combined being 43.

        <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A summary of the different platforms (devices and browsers) that
                your testers used.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The testers were asked which devices they used to test the website, and the results are as follows:
            x on phone, x on computer. Respondents were asked about their browser, and the results are as follows:
            x on Chrome, x on Safari, x on Brave, x on Firefox, x on Tor, x on other.

        <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A summary of the feedback you received organized by
                question type (design, navigation, content, usability, etc.). Highlight both positive
                comments and thoughtful criticism, your client's testimonial, etc.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            A lot of the comments we recieved from those testing were that the first impression of the website was good, in general people
            were fond of the design choices we have made for our showcase sites. 
            When it comes to user friendliness a lot of the feedback was positive regarding navigating through the website, however we
            got some valuable comments on a few elements of the site which could be improved. 
            For instance when you're in the checkout 
            menu it's not intuitive how to remove the selected images from your shopping cart.
            Some users reported problems with the carousel and text on the home page.

        <h2>Our Response</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
                you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
                design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
                suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            We have made some changes to the website based on the feedback we recieved. 
            We have also added a "back to top" button to the bottom of the page, to make it easier to navigate back to the top of the page.
            Another issue we decided to fix were the problems that occured with the carousel and the text for the home page.

        <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
                nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
                seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
                answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
                hear.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Teamwork and communication is key. We have learned how difficult it can 
            be to work with several people in the same documents and quite a bit about git.
            One of the group members spent a couple of weeks without being able to fetch the
            git repo, but luckily the team was able to help him out. We have also learned
            how difficult it can be to communicate with a client. Neither party had any
            experience with making a website, so it wasn't easy to know what could and couldn't
            be done.
