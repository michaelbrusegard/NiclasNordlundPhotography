        <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more, and has been looking for an easier way for customers to 
            reach him, as well as a way to showcase his previous work.</p>

        <h2>Testing Document</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A brief summary of the questionnaire you send out to testers, as
                well as the link to the Google Form you used. Don't forget to ask your client to test
                the website.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The questionnaire contained a link to the website and a brief introduction to our project. 
            It started out with questions about device, age and amount of bugs found, for sorting the data.
            The rest of the questions were about the website itself, and how the user felt about it.
            The questionnaire can be found <a style="color:aquamarine" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/16Lm8wyiBhZxIMt8XvDoH7awGWspav1qLcgv_KD03Vs4/edit">here</a>. 
            We then asked about user experience, and how the user felt about the website.
            In the end, we asked if anything did not work as expected, and if the user had any other comments.

        <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                A description of your efforts to reach testers that are similar to the
                website's intended audience and how successful you were (give the percentages of
                your tester audience once you aggregate their answers, e.g., 23% of college
                students, 46% school administrators, etc.) If you are collecting age-ranges, you can
                do the same. If you were able to do live testing with a few users, describe that as
                well.

            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Provide your response to the feedback. Concretely, describe what
                you could do (once the class is over) to address this feedback with changes in your
                design or implementation. You can also address why some of the raised issues or
                suggestions for improvements are difficult or impossible to tackle.

        <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <!-- Task description, keep temporarily while writing -->
            <em>
                Step back and reflect on the whole project experience and what you
                learned from it. Are there general lessons that you learned, beyond the
                nuts-and-bolts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? We would like you to take this
                seriously and be thoughtful about your comments, but there is no right or wrong
                answer here, so don't feel that you have to flatter us or try to divine what we want to
                hear.
