        <h3>Administrative Details</h3>
        <p>Our client is Niclas Nordlund, a photographer from Åland, Finland. 
            He is a freelance photographer who specializes in photos of animals,
            landscapes, events and more. Additionally, he sells calendars, and 
            wants an easier way for customers to reach him.</p>

        <h3>Purpose and goals</h3>
        <p>
            The main purpose of the website will be to promote and showcase Niclas' 
            previous photography work. He wants to make it easy for potential clients
            (both companies or individuals) to browse through the work he has already 
            done, and get a general sense of what he is capable of as a photographer.  
            A secondary objective would
            be to implement a payment solution, or an otherwise convenient way of 
            purchasing products/services through the website, such as ordering
            calendars or digital photos directly.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            The main audience for the website is professional customers interested in 
            Niclas’ photos. The site is therefore intended to showcase his previous 
            work and make it easier to sell photographs without having to be in contact 
            with every single customer manually. Another aspect is his need to demonstrate 
            the different products. Since the intended audience is primarily professionals, 
            the website needs to appear professional as well. In order to reach new 
            potential customers, the website needs to demonstrate what types of photography 
            he is most experienced with, such as landscapes and wedding photos. He also 
            wants to sell calendars, which are intended for non-professional customers. 
        </p>

        <h3>The content of the site and how it is organized</h3>
        <p>
            The main site will contain different categories of photos. Niclas has asked us
            to include at least landscapes, animals, weddings and portraits, but these are 
            not necessarily the only categories that will be included. Niclas is not sure 
            whether he will be able to get the rights to use all his wedding photos, but 
            will update us. We want to include a shopping cart where customers can purchase 
            the rights to photos in certain categories, but the checkout and collection of 
            personal information will not happen on our site. We need a way for customers 
            to reach Niclas, and will therefore include a “contact me” tab. Additionally, 
            we will make an “about me” tab with a short bio about him and links to his 
            social media channels.

        <h3>Functional and Non-Functional Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            For the functional requirements the website will allow for easy navigation both on the same page and throughout the entire website, 
            our goal is to have a shop-function available for customers to place orders.
            We will also assist in the possibility for customers to either come in direct contact with our client, or if they wish the see more of his photos
            by links on our website which will redirect customers to his social media.
            As for the non-functional requirements we want the photos to formatted properly in order for the website to load as quickly as possible for the customers.
            For the website to be scaled appropriately for different devices. The website will be available across multiple web-browsers.

            Final location
        </h3>
        <p>
            We will host the webpage at Michael's <a href="folk.ntnu/michbrus/NiclasNordlundPhotography/Site/home.html ">folk.ntnu</a> 
            page when the project is finished. Michael will also host the webpage on a custom server with a custom domain for the customer. 
            There may be a few differences between the version on folk.ntnu and the custom server. For 
            instance if we get a working payment solution, we will disable it on folk.ntnu.
